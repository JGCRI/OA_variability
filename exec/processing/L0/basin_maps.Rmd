Hi Corinne, I wanted to check with you about the basins we discussed yesterday I have in my notes to look at Global, Northern, Southern, Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. 

This is what I have right now set as my basin boundaries. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
out$table
```

 
Maps with the boundary lines drawn. Sorry that some times the text can be hard to read. That is why I included the table above. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
out$maps$global
out$maps$northern
out$maps$southern
out$maps$atlantic
out$maps$pacific
out$maps$indian
out$maps$arctic
```
